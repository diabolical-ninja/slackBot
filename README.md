# Simple Slackbot
This is a simple slack bot that says hi, has a couple of joke & can undestand basic commands.

It listens for itself & then attempts to interpret the question & act appriopriately. 
The question interpretation is currently quite simple/stupid but if identified will then execute the corresponding funcation.
While not ideal it is designed so that new capabilities (of a similar format/type) to the existing ones can be easily added.


To run you will need:
* The slack API Token
* The userid of your slack bot
* These settings stored in a yaml file called "conf.eymal"
